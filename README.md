# PongPCB
This is a KiCad project and Gerber files for Pong Composite Video replacement PCB, as fetured in the original [Dave's Garage episode](https://youtu.be/iF7lo0vU_WI).

In theory you should be able to order a board from JLCPCB using just the Gerber files (specifically, the already-packed 'Archive.zip' in the Gerbers folder). 
Or you could use KiCad to load the project and generate your own Gerber and Drill files.

A list of the components that need to be soldered onto the PCB is included in [PARTSLIST.md](PARTSLIST.md). A list of other components is included in the video description on YouTube.
