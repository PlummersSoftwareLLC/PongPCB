# PongPCB
This is a KiCad project and Gerber files for Pong Composite Video replacement PCB.  You can find the original Dave's Garage episode here:

In theory you should be able to order a board from JLCPCB using just the Gerber files (specifically, the already-packed 'Archive.zip' in the Gerbers folder). 
Or you could use KiCad to load the project and generate your own Gerber and Drill files.
