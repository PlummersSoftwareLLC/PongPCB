# Parts list

Below is the list of components that need to be installed onto the PCB, as indicated on the PCB design. A list of (other) components with purchase links is already available in the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/iF7lo0vU_WI) description. The links in the table below are to reference information only.

| Category | Value/type | Quantity | Board location(s) | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Capacitor | 30pF | 2 | C1, C2 | |
| Capacitor | 0.1&#181;F | 2 | C3, C4 | |
| Crystal oscillator | HC49U 2.0MHz, or equivalent | 1 | Y1 | Oscillators are available in a wide range of frequencies, make sure to get the 2.0 MHz type! |
| DC barrel power connector | horizontal | 2 | J1, J4 | |
| IC | [AY-3-8500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AY-3-8500) | 1 | U1 | Has to be taken from the Coleco Telstar PCB, or another system that's based on it. If sockets are used, this IC must not be soldered but inserted into the socket after that has been soldered in. |
| IC | DIL-14 [4001](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Practical_Electronics/IC/4001) | 1 | U3 | Can be taken from the Coleco Telstar PCB. If buying separately, note that a surface-mount version (SOIC-14) is also available that won't work for this build. If sockets are used, this IC must not be soldered but inserted into the socket after that has been soldered in. |
| IC | DIL-14 [4072](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Practical_Electronics/IC/4072) | 1 | U2 | Can be taken from the Coleco Telstar PCB. If buying separately, note that a surface-mount version (SOIC-14) is also available that won't work for this build. If sockets are used, this IC must not be soldered but inserted into the socket after that has been soldered in. |
| Pin header | 2 pins | 1 | J5 | |
| Pin header | 14 pins | 1 | J2 | |
| RCA connector | RCJ-044 | 1 | J3 | |
| Resistor | 47&#8486; | 1 | R12 | |
| Resistor | 75&#8486; | 1 | R6 | |
| Resistor | 220&#8486; | 4 | R2, R5, R8, R9 | |
| Resistor | 330&#8486; | 1 | R10 | |
| Resistor | 510&#8486; | 2 | R3, R11 | |
| Resistor | 10K&#8486; | 2 | R4, R7 | |
| Resistor | 12M&#8486; | 1 | R1 | |
| Socket | 14 pins | 2 | U2, U3 | Use of sockets is recommended, but strictly speaking optional. |
| Socket | 28 pins | 1 | U1 | Use of sockets is recommended, but strictly speaking optional. |
| Transistor | [2N3904](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N3904) | 1 | Q1 | |
